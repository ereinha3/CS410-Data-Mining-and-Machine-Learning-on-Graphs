# Assignment 1: Network Analysis and Graph Theory

This assignment explores fundamental concepts in network analysis and graph theory through both theoretical understanding and practical implementation.

## Overview

The assignment covers various aspects of network analysis including:
- Network attributes and properties
- Random graph construction
- Degree distribution analysis
- Degree centrality calculations
- Graph visualization
- Analysis of real-world networks (CollegeMsg.txt dataset)

## Files

- `q5.py`: Implementation of random graph construction and analysis
- `q8.py`: Network visualization and analysis
- `q9.py`: Additional graph analysis implementations
- `CollegeMsg.txt`: Real-world network dataset for analysis
- `AS1.pdf`: Assignment specification and requirements

## Running the Code

1. Ensure you have the required dependencies installed:
   ```bash
   pip install networkx matplotlib numpy
   ```

2. Run individual questions using Python 3:
   ```bash
   python3 q5.py  # For question 5
   python3 q8.py  # For question 8
   python3 q9.py  # For question 9
   ```

Each script will execute the corresponding analysis and may generate visualizations or output results to the console.

## Data

The `CollegeMsg.txt` dataset represents a real-world social network. The scripts will automatically load and process this data when needed.

## Output

- Graphs and visualizations will be displayed using matplotlib
- Statistical analysis results will be printed to the console
- Some scripts may generate output files with detailed results

## Note

Make sure to review the assignment specification in `AS1.pdf` for detailed requirements and context for each question.
